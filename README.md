## Description

It features accessibility and offline features; thus everyone can use this site at all time.

## Installation

1. When using VS Code, install the Live Server Extension to start a server to view this project on. Click the icon on the bottom right of your screen stating 'Go Live' and you'll be ready to go. Remember to update your port in dbhelper.js

Otherwise, go the Python route:
In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
